# Step 1: Create your Flask application

First we are going to create our web application. 

## Structure Explanation:
In our home [**repository page**](https://github.com/dk-fern/flaskWebApp-with-docker) the files for the web app are:
- [**The Website Directory**](https://github.com/dk-fern/flaskWebApp-with-docker/tree/main/Website) -- This holds the contents to our web application including all the HTML, Python code, and images used.
- app.py -- This is the code that launches the application. Naming this code 'app.py' is a common convention used in Flask
