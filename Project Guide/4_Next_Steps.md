# Great Job!
You've finished the project. Let's take a moment to look back at what you've learned and created, and some next steps to continue learning in these topics.

### What we've done
In this project we:
- Learned a bit about Flask, a web application framework for Python and used it to create our own custom *resume style* web application.
- Learned about containers and Docker. We created our own Dockerfile needed to turn our web app into a Docker image, which we then used to create a Docker container. We also created our own Docker Hub account that now holds our web application container image
- Learned about Infrastructure as Code and Terraform. Although we only scratched the surface on what Terraform can really do, we learned about why IaC tools are used, and got some firsthand experience with them.

Thanks for using this project and I encourage you to add it to your resume!

### Deeper learning and links
If you enjoyed any aspects of this project, I would strongly recommend continuing to learn some of the topics we've discussed. I've found that having a learner mindset is one of the most valuable assets you can have.

**Python**
- [Harvard's CS50 Python course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/) - Harvard gives away this intro to Python course for free, and I couldn't think of how it could be any better.

**Flask**
- [Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/)
- [Flask project to create a whole website (youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dam0GPOAvVI)

**Docker**
- [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/)
- [One hour Docker Tutorial for Beginners (youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTFZFxd4hOI)

**Azure**
- [Learn Azure in a Month of Lunches](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-learn-azure-in-a-month-of-lunches.html) - Remember, you still have $200 worth of free Azure credit to use for the month and this is a great (although a little old) resource to continue learning.

**Terraform**
- [Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/) - I mentioned this before, but their documentation is super clear and easy to follow.
- [HashiCorp Github for Azure provider](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm) - view the *examples* folder for some solid examples of Terraform config files for a wide variety of use cases.

### Thanks again and happy learning!
