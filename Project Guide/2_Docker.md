# Step 2: Containerize Your Application

A container is a lightweight and portable software package that contains everything needed to run an application, including code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. As the name would suggest, a container can be transported to any machine that has the container engine (Docker in our case), and ran without installation. Additionally, containers are isolated from the host environment so running a container inherently doesn't affect the computer it's being run on.

### Container vs Virtual Machine

One benefit of containers is that they don't need a ton of resources. As seen in the diagram below, while a VM needs a hypervisor, and its own operating system to run on top of the host OS, a container uses the host kernel/OS with a container engine to run individual container images making it more lightweight, but still isolated from the host environment.
